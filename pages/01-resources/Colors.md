# Colors

Sushi provides a set of predefined colors in its palette.

For extremely unique cases, feel free to use your own colors, but otherwise, we recommend
using colors from this palette for all components.

## Usage

All colors are defined in resources, you can access them as following

```xml
<!--  Our black and white are slightly off shade
from #000 and #fff for better readability -->
@colors/sushi_black
@colors/sushi_white

<!-- Primary colors have 9 shades and secondary have 5 -->

@colors/sushi_grey_500
@colors/sushi_red_600
@colors/sushi_indigo_100

<!-- ..and so on... -->
```
